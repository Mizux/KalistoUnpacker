Unpacker for Kallisto data files (KBF/KIX) found in "New York Race" game

New York Race is a (not too popular) racing game developed by Kallisto Entertainment and released in 2001.

I got the game as a free bundle with a PC magazine many years ago when i was a child and i found the game to be a funny small racing game with its own touch.

I re-discovered it in recent times and, since i couldn't find any information about KBF/KIX files, i decided to write an unpacker for them.

Based on my discoveries, the KBF extension stands for "Kallisto Binary File" and KIX stands for "Kallisto Index File". I don't own any other Kallisto-made game to verify if other games also use the same binary format, but you're free to try this tool and see if it works for you
